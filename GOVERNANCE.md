# Governance

FERMO is an application for metabolomics data prioritization and orthogonal data integration.

Its development and maintenance is supervised by the FERMO Metabolomics Organization.
Discussion on the governance model is taking place in the FERMO Metabolomics [Discussions Page](https://github.com/orgs/fermo-metabolomics/discussions/1).

This document is inspired by the [Bioregistry Governance model](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/blob/main/docs/GOVERNANCE.md).

## Governing Body

The FERMO Governing Body oversees the maintenance and development of FERMO and its related repositories.

Its key responsibilities include:

- Members must be listed alphabetically by last name [below](#members).

#### Member Onboarding

New members of the FERMO Governing Body will:

## Bootstrapping governance

This governance model takes effect on May 1, 2025.

## Updating governance

Governance updates follow this process:

1. Propose changes in the FERMO Metabolomics Discussion Page [Governance Mega-Thread](https://github.com/orgs/fermo-metabolomics/discussions/1)
2. Engage potential stakeholders in discussion.
3. Solicit a review from the FERMO Governing Body.
4. Approval: The Governing Body will review and accept changes at its discretion.

This process does not apply to minor edits (e.g., formatting, grammar, or structural improvements), which may be made ad hoc.
The FERMO Governing Body may also unilaterally modify this document and will announce any changes on the FERMO Metabolomics Discussion Page.
